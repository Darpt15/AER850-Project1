# AER850-Project1
 Augmented Reality (AR) based instruction modules through predictive machine learning (ML) algorithms have been a growing field of study, as there is scope for making the AR modules more efficient and accurate primarily for the manufacturing and maintenance sectors within the aerospace industry. A micro-level coordinate system approach is an effective way to utilize ML models to optimize the current AR-based animation techniques, incorporating such models with the existing technology allows technicians to gain better insights while performing their tasks which include: Aircraft maintenance, computer-aided design and modelling, part assembly and routine maintenance for space-related applications. 2 Project Outline This project allows for exploring various classification-based ML algorithms to successfully predict the maintenance step/stage given a specific part and its coordinates. The part utilized for this project is an inverter of the FlightMax Fill Motion Simulator.
